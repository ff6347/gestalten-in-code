Actually the idea for the algorithm was brought up by a student. That it nearly the same as [John Venn's diagramm](http://dada.compart-bremen.de/item/artwork/621) from 1866 came out later. You also should take a look at [Manfred Mohr's P018 Random Walk](http://www.emohr.com/sc69-73/vfile_18.html) from 1969 which resembles the algorithm as well. The algorihm below works with a one dimensional array. To see the same algoritm with a two dimensional array you can take a [look here.](https://github.com/ff6347/neighbours)
