summary: This sample shows a dynamic grid, that changes the width and height of itself.  
---

The grid changes the size of the rectangles that are built through the grid each time by clicking the updating button. It is a non symetric drawn horizontal and vertical line canvas, that makes it interesting for drawing sheet.
