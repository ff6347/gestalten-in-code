> What? P5? I thought it is Processing. Is it P5.js or what?

The naming "P5" is not a known convention. It is rather my own term to combine all those flavors of Processing into one single title. Why mixing them all together? In the last several years I tried to teach each of these frameworks on its own. It turned out that each has its advantages and disadvantages _(who would have thought of that)_. if you want to create something for the web - use [P5.js](/gestalten-in-code/p5js). If you want lots of particles or interact with hardware - use [Processing](/gestalten-in-code/processing) and if you need fine grained macro typography go for [Basil.js](/gestalten-in-code/basiljs) or [Extendscript](/gestalten-in-code/extendscript). Don't lock yourself in one box. Use the right tool for the right job.  

## Processing [{% include icon-link.html %}]({{site.baseurl}}/processing)  

{% include filtered-index-overview.html param="processing" %}

## Basil.js [{% include icon-link.html %}]({{site.baseurl}}/basiljs)

{% include filtered-index-overview.html param="Basil.js" %}

## P5.js [{% include icon-link.html %}]({{site.baseurl}}/p5js)

{% include filtered-index-overview.html param="P5.js" %}

## Extendscript [{% include icon-link.html %}]({{site.baseurl}}/extendscript)

{% include filtered-index-overview.html param="extendscript" %}
